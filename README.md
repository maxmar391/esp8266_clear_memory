## Bill of materials
* ESP8266 or ESP32 board
* Micro USB cable
* Arduino IDE


## Notes
* The empty folder "data" is very important and must be saved in the same folder as the provided Arduino sketch.
* The folder "tools" is very important and must be saved in the same folder as the folder containing the Arduino sketch and the empty "data" folder. This should basically be the working directory of your Arduino IDE. 
* The ESP8266 or ESP32 library must be installed in the Arduino IDE before the sketch can be used.
